General:

Documentation:
    When an element returns None, subsequent
    elements are still triggered

    Exceptions:
    Elements should throw an exception when configuration
    data is missing or cannot be processed

    Elements should try to handle all possible exceptions internally
    and only throw unhandled exceptions

    The result of a operation (if successfull or not) should
    be forwarded to subsequent elements in order to react to
    a possible unsuccesfull operation

    When input data is required to perform some task and it
    is missing, elements should pass this information to subsequent elements
    and not throw an exception.d


CCXT Method: Remove large if-else areas for parsing config

Python: Add type hints

Check if the 'inline'-keyword can be applied to some loops

Elementeditor:
Add the possibility to pass arbitrary number of keyword arguments or
to build a dictionary from within the editor
