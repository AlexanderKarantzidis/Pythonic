    Terms:
        Configuration Data: Parameters passed over the GUI by the user
        Input Data: Data which is forwarded from other elements

    General behaviour:
        When an element returns None, subsequent
        elements are still triggered

    Exceptions:

        #1
        Elements should throw an exception when configuration
        data is missing or cannot be processed

        #2
        Elements should try to handle all possible exceptions internally
        and only throw critical exceptions.

        #3
        If appropriate, the result of a operation (if successfull or not) should
        be forwarded to subsequent elements in order to react to
        a possible unsuccesfull operation. When it was not possible to process the input data, return the PythonicError with related information.
        Combine this with logging.warning (preferred) or logging.error.

        #4
        Avoid to use logging.error or logging.warning without the other mechanisms as those methods will only write to the log.
